# this tests a problem I had where GETG would put a global array on the
# stack.  during garbage collection it would get moved as a global, but
# the references on the stack would then be moved as a duplicate. thus
# some updates would go missing.
#
# this was fixed using a forwarding list for moved arrays.  it could be
# avoided by redesigning arrays in the bytecode.
